This is not an actual lie detector test. It relies on random number generation in inferring results.

# Shckr
A lie detector application that utilizes phone's torch to cause a minor "shock" to liars.

It is the digital counterpart of the current lie detector trend. It uses the same principle as the "sharpie shock challenge" to produce a shock.

# Developer's Note
Just a silly app I created to play with my friends as well as to practice creating a multi-module application.
